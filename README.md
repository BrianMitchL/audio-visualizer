# audio-visualizer

A site to control and display audio visualizations, all from the browser.

See the application at https://brianm.me/audio-visualizer/

The control page allows the user to select an audio device and does the work to
analyze the audio.
The visualization page shows the visualization.

You should grant access (and remember decision) to the site for
microphone/audio use, and reload the control page in order to see the list of
device names.
